Customize the configuration and make it your own, with a selection of rich woods, stones and finishes.Perfect for your patio, the Rapson Cocktail Table by Loll Design is part of a collection inspired by midcentury architect Ralph Rapson. Sculptural and sleek, yet low maintenance and easy to clean, this piece is made entirely from recycled plastic in your choice of a variety of colours.This summer we’ve also introduced new products by Toronto-based design studio, Castor. A winner of several design awards and a Stylegarage staff favourite – the Induction Light Tube operates using a magnetic field to transfer electrical current from the cube shaped base to a regular fluorescent light bulb.The Lily Table by Good Thing functions as a stackable indoor/outdoor side table, and when pulled up to a sofa or chair can be used as a mobile work/snack station. We appreciate the versatility, but we also love the fun silhouette and the fresh shades of colours."

    "description": "Sustainable Lumber, Did you know that every Gus* sofa features a kiln-dried 100% FSC®-Certified hardwood frame? That’s right, all of your favourite styles are constructed from sustainable lumber sourced from responsibly managed forests. It’s the perfect beginning to this green story – and it only gets better. Vegan Down,The plushest sofas from Gus* Modern now use PET-fill – a soft, pillowy fibre that’s a huge improvement over natural down. Unlike traditional down, PET is made from thousands of recycled plastic water bottles. According to our friends at Gus*, this innovative material diverts around 600,000 plastic bottles from landfills each year.What’s more, PET-fill helps upholstery keep its shape longer, and won’t poke you with features while you’re snuggling. Check out the Gus* Parkdale and Logan sofas to feel the bounce for yourself. You won’t believe it’s not down – and now 20% off during the Gus* Summer Sale! Flame Retardant-Free,Other furniture makers might have stopped there, but not Gus*. All of their sofas are made without the use of flame retardants in the upholstery foam. However, their collection still meets California TB117-2013 fire safety standards. So, your family will be safe from hazardous chemicals, as will the environment.Come talk to our sales team about how Gus* Modern sofas are making the other guys green with envy."
